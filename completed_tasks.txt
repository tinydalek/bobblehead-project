COMPLETED TASKS

1. Validate the form on your contact page. Ensure that all text has content, and that the content conforms to requirements (you decide and document what those requirements are).

2. When the form has been validated, show a confirm dialog box that displays the data entered and asks the user if the data entered is correct. If yes, thank the visitor and submit the form. If no, prevent the form from submitting so users can go back and make adjustments where necessary. Ensure the form fields remain populated with data.

6. Add functionality to the index.html page. When the user moves the mouse over one of the images, a brief description of the bobblehead should appear in the form of a rich tooltip. Moving the mouse off the image should make the image description disappear.

10. Create an image gallery that allows the user to move through a selection of 'recommended' bobbleheads. The user should be able to move backward and forward through the selection.
NOTE: I did this task for all available bobbleheads on my Collections page.

11. Modify the index.html page, so that the news items are listed by headline only. When a headline is selected, a story should open underneath it (moving all the other headlines down).

SCRIPTS

bootstrap/js folder

1. jquery-3.2.1.min.js 
2. bootstrap.min.js

The bootstrap and jquery scripts were used to provide functionality and responsiveness across the entire website.

I used the javascript built into boostrap to complete Task 10. I did this by using class="carousel slide" to display the images. I used data-interval="fasle" to stop the carousel from rotating. I then used:
<a data-slide="prev" class="carousel-control left"><</a>
<a data-slide="next" class="carousel-control right">></a>
To create the previous and next buttons allowing the user to scroll through the collections.

I used the javascript built into bootstrap to complete Task 11. I did this by using class="panel-collapse collapse". I chose to have the first news item displayed when the page loads using class="panel-collapse collapse in". This item will then collapse, when a new news item is opened.
